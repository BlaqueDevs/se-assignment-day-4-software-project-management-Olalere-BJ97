2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

Advantages of Waterfall
1. Easy to manage: Waterfall is a straightforward approach that is easy to manage and understand.
2. Predictable timeline: Waterfall provides a predictable timeline, making it easier to plan and schedule.
3. Clear requirements: Waterfall requires clear and well-defined requirements, which helps to avoid misunderstandings.

Disadvantages of Waterfall
1. Inflexible: Waterfall is an inflexible approach that makes it difficult to accommodate changes in requirements.
2. High risk: Waterfall has a high risk of project failure due to the lack of flexibility and the difficulty in accommodating changes.
3. Long development cycle: Waterfall has a long development cycle, which can lead to a delayed release.

Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, where the project is broken down into smaller chunks, and each chunk is developed and delivered in a short iteration.

Advantages of Agile
1. Flexible: Agile is a flexible approach that allows for changes in requirements and adapts to changing project needs.
2. Faster time-to-market: Agile enables faster time-to-market, as the project is broken down into smaller chunks, and each chunk is delivered in a short iteration.
3. Improved quality: Agile ensures improved quality, as the project is continuously tested and refined.

Disadvantages of Agile
1. Complex to manage: Agile is a complex approach that requires skilled project managers and team members.
2. Unpredictable timeline: Agile has an unpredictable timeline, making it challenging to plan and schedule.
3. Higher cost: Agile may require higher costs, as the project is continuously refined and tested.

Key Differences Between Agile and Waterfall
1. Approach: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, while Waterfall is a linear approach.
2. Flexibility: Agile is flexible and adaptable, while Waterfall is inflexible and rigid.
3. Timeline: Agile has an unpredictable timeline, while Waterfall has a predictable timeline.
4. Quality: Agile ensures improved quality, while Waterfall may compromise on quality.

Choosing Between Agile and Waterfall
1. Project complexity: Agile is suitable for complex projects with changing requirements, while Waterfall is suitable for simple projects with well-defined requirements.
2. Team experience: Agile requires skilled and experienced team members, while Waterfall can be managed by less experienced team members.
3. Time-to-market: Agile enables faster time-to-market, while Waterfall has a longer development cycle.
4. Budget: Agile may require higher costs, while Waterfall has a fixed budget.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Answer:
Agile and Waterfall are two popular project management methodologies that cater to different project requirements and team dynamics. Here's a breakdown of when Agile might be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa:
